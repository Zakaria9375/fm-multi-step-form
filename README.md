* Zooming: Maintains content and functionality without loss when zooming.
* Keyboard-only navigation: All interactive elements are fully accessible, focusable, and clickable via keyboard.
* Static code analysis: Ensures no errors through the use of semantic HTML.
* Aria rules compliance: Proper implementation of ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) rules.
* Semantic HTML: Employs clean, semantic HTML when ever possible for better accessibility.
